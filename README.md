# BlobFit
Android application built in Unity using C#, makes use of the inbuilt GPS and Accelerometer.

BlobFit is a virtual pet game, inspired by Tamagotchi, that uses gamification techniques to encourage children to exercise on a regular basis. BlobFit uses the inbuilt GPS and accelerometer functions of an android phone device to track movement over the course of a day and uses this information to feed a pet 'Blob' and dictate its mood. 

Blobs are powered by exercise and will grow in size and number over time if they are kept fed. If you don't exercise, your Blob will become unhappy and eventually, starve to death.
